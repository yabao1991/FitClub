The Fitness App industry is dominated by multiple players that have disparate UI / Dashboard applications for their consumers. 
This results in platform dependent groups that are isolated from other devices that their friends/family members might be using. 
This Platform dependence also means that one has limited scope of motivating or being challenged by his peers if they do not share the same device. 


The solution we offer is an Omni Channel Cross Device Health Tracking App. that pulls in data from different wearable devices.
This app can be used to combine data from the below devices / platforms to build a common view for all users to compare and benchmark them against.
Wearable Tech : Apple Watch, Samsung Gear, Garmin, Fitbit etc.
Free health Apps :Runtastic, Run Keeper
